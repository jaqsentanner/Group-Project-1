# E News App (Group Project)

## Description 

The purpose of this application is to provide real-time news and weather information to our end user. We wanted to create a user friendly, one-stop web application that could deliver news and weather to a user anywhere in the world!


## What Adversity did we face during the E News design phase?

This project challenged every member of our team in new ways and brought us together to tackle real problems and learn how to pair-program. We all worked diligently on our individual tasks, but faced some complications when first trying to merge features and branches together. Thankfully, we were able to bring everything together through determination and deliver a minimum viable product. 


## Future Development

In our next iteration of "E News" we plan on implementing Matt's hourly weather forecasting feature into the live version of our application. Additionally, Jesus is designing a "favorite news" side panel that can utilize Tai's local storage feature. We plan to roll both of these out in the next update.
